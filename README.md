# FinLedger

FinLedger is a lightweight personal finance dashboard that lets you upload CSV exports from your bank and explore your income and expenses. The tool runs entirely in the browser and stores transactions locally so you keep full control over your data.

## Features

- Import CSV statements with automatic delimiter and header detection
- Categorise transactions with sensible defaults for common German banking exports
- Filter by month or search by description, payee, or category
- Visualise spending by category and keep an eye on income, expenses, and balance totals
- Switch between dark and light theme, with preferences saved in local storage

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies and start the development server:

   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the provided local URL in your browser.
3. Upload a CSV export from your online banking portal. The parser understands German style dates (`31.12.2024`) and decimal commas.
